            <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unpopped popcorn kernels</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in popcorn kernels and sugar.</li>
            <li>Cover and shake the pot constantly to prevent sugar from burning. When popping has slowed to once every 2 to 3 seconds, remove the pot from the heat and shake for a few minutes until popping stops.</li>
            <li>Pour popcorn into a large bowl and allow to cool, stirring occasionally to break up large clumps.</li>
