        <p>A good seasoned rib-eye steak recipe to prepare for a family dinner!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4(1/2 pound) rib-eye steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for brushing grill</li>
        </ul>
         
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season steaks with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper; set aside.</li>
            <li>Place Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar into a large resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and shake to mix. Pour 1/2 of the marinade into another large resealable plastic bag. Place 2 steaks in each bag and turn to coat. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bags. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Drain marinade from the bags into a small saucepan; bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Grill steaks on the preheated grill to desired doneness, about 7 minutes per side. Baste often with boiled marinade during the final 5 minutes of cook time. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steaks should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
